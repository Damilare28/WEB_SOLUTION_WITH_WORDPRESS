# WEB_SOLUTION_WITH_WORDPRESS

## Preparing storage infrastructure on two Linux servers and implementing a basic WEB SOLUTION USING WORDPRESS

### Introdution:

This project involves preparing storage infrastructure on two Linux servers and implement a basic web solution using WORDPRESS.

WORDPRESS is a free and open-source content management system written in PHP and paired with MySQL or MariaDB as its backend Relational
Database Management System (RDBMS).

It consists of two parts:

1. Configure storage subsystem for Web and Database servers based on Linux OS. The focus of
   this part is to give you practical experience of working with disks, partitions and volumes in
   Linux.

2. Install WordPress and connect it to a remote MySQL database server. This part of the project
   will solidify your skills of deploying Web and DB tiers of Web solution.

Generally, web, or mobile solutions are implemented based on what is called the **Three-tier Architecture.**

Three-tier Architecture is a client-server software architecture pattern that comprise of 3 separate layers.

In this project will be implementing this solution based on what is called the **Three-tier Architecture.**

**Three-tier Architecture** is a client-server software architecture pattern that comprise of 3 separate layers.

### PREREQUISITE

## The 3-Tier Setup

1. A Laptop or PC to serve as a client
2. An EC2 Linux Server as a web server (This is where you will install WordPress)
3. An EC2 Linux server as a database (DB) server
